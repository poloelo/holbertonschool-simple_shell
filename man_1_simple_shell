.SH NAME
hsh \- simple command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[command_file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.

.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal, an interactive shell is opened. When
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes commands in the order they are received.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After receiving a command,
.B hsh
tokenizes it into words using spaces as delimiters. The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command. 
.B hsh
then proceeds with the following actions:

.RS
1. If the first character of the command is a slash (/) or dot (.), the shell attempts to execute the command directly.
.RE

.RS
2. Otherwise, the shell searches for the command in the directories specified in the PATH environment variable.

3. If the command is found, the shell forks a child process and executes the command.

4. If the command is not found, an error message is printed.
